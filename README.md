###  Youth

```markdown
And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17.
I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. 
And well all become somebody's moms and dad.

But right now,these moments are not stories.this is happening」am here.
And I looking at her. And she is so beautiful. I can see it.
This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. 
You are alive.and you stand up and see the lights on buildings,
and everything that makes you wonder.
And you are listening to that song on that drive with the people you love most in this world.
And in this moment,I swear,we are infinite.

-- The Perks of Being a Wallflower

### 一首诗

如下：

```markdown
Funeral Blues      
Stop all the clocks, 
cut off the telephone, 
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum Bring out the coffin, 
let the mourners come. 

Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead. 
Put crepe bows round the white necks of public doves, 
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves. 
He was my North, 
my South, 
my East and West. 
My working week and my Sunday rest, 
My noon, 
my midnight, 
my talk, 
my song; 
I thought that love would last forever; 
I was wrong. 
The stars are not wanted now: 
put out every one; 
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun; 
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood; 
For nothing now can ever come to any good.   

-- W. H. Auden
